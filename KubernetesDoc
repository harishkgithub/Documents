$ kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o wide 

1)Pods 

2)rs -> ReplicaSet is improved verison of rc -> ReplicaContainer 
rs has label based selectore

$ kubectl create -f replication.yaml 
replicationcontroller "nginx" created -> kind: ReplicaContainer inside yaml file 

ReplicaSet does not needs to be created explicitly, inside our deployment section itself "spec" can be used to represent "ReplicaSet"
$ watch -n0 kubectl get all 

3)Deployments
  B/G deployment -> deploy all at once 
  Canary -> deploy increamentally

4)Services 
    service would wrap around deployment

kubectl get pods | grep -i "<podname>"

kubectl get deployment

kubectl scale deployment <podname> --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment <podname> --replicas=1

kubectl describe deployment <deploymentName>

kubectl edit deployment <deploymentName> -o yaml

kubectl apply -f <deployment>.yml
output :
  deployment.apps/<deployment> configured
